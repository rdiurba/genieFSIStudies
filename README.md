Working repository for truth-level studies on GENIE using both neutrino and hadron event generation (https://github.com/GENIE-MC/Generator)

Purpose is to test DUNE and ProtoDUNE-ND performance with various GENIE FSIs and to tune KO/Abs. hadron-A scattering.

Builds on work for nusystematics (https://github.com/luketpickering/nusystematics/tree/develop) and BuildEventGenerators (https://github.com/afropapp13/BuildEventGenerators)

Requires UPS products found on cvmfs on Fermilab. Nusystematics is not required if generating neutrino interaction uncertainty weights is not required.
